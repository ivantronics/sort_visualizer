I stumbled upon youtube video once and it's author explored various demo projects to show your potential employer. One of the projects was sorting algorithms visualizer that helped this person to get an interview and later a job offer from very prestigious company. Naturally I tried to code one myself, things happened and you can see the results in the fruits of the happening.
